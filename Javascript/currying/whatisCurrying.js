//callable function from func(a,b,c) to fun(a)(b)(c)

/*
What is Currying?
Currying is a function that takes one argument at a time and returns a new function expecting the next argument. It is a conversion of functions from callable as f(a,b,c)into callable as f(a)(b)(c).

Why should currying be used?
Following are the reasons why currying is good :

✅ It makes a function pure which makes it expose to less errors and side effects.

✅ It helps in avoiding the same variable again and again.

✅ It is a checking method that checks if you have all the things before you proceed.

✅ It divides one function into multiple functions so that one handles one set of responsibility.


How does currying work?
Currying is a function that takes multiple arguments as input. It transform the function into a number of functions where every function will accept one argument.
